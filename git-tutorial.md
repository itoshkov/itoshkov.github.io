In this tutorial I'll try to describe how git works without using git itself.
Instead, we'll create a simple, git-like system using just `zip`, `diff`,
`patch` and a few simple filesystem commands. The idea is to build a good mental
model of how git works _conceptually_.

You can [go here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) if you prefer to watch this
tutorial instead of reading it.

We'll be developing our system by solving the problems we face one at a time.
There are many solutions to each of them as you can see by the plethora of
Version Control Systems (VCS) developed since
[1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#History). Our own choices
will be informed by git's choices. For example it tracks changes between
snapshots - the current state of the project as a whole, whereas some other
VCSes track changes of individual files.

### Why Do We Need Version Control Systems?

Software development is hard. Developing anything but the most trivial programs
takes a lot of time and effort. Often we need to change things to:
* fix bugs
* implement new features
* accommodate new requirements
* make architectural changes as the program grows
* etc.

It is not uncommon to need to maintain several versions of our software
simultaneously. This is especially true for applications that are installed on
premise, like desktop and mobile apps, but even if we are developing an internal
web application we need to be able publish bug-fixes and develop new features at
the same time.

Moreover, many projects are developed by teams of people. Collaborating without
_accidentally_ deleting other people's code is essential.

Accomplishing these tasks gets increasingly harder, with the size of the project
and the team. It is very easy to mess things up if you don't have a good system
to help you.

## Version Control Without Git

### The Humble Beginning

Let's start by creating our new project:

```bash
mkdir ProjectX
cd ProjectX
```

And let's put our top-secret program in `main.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
	printf("ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.");
}
```

This is our starting point. This is our first version and we want to save it and
be able to come back to it. One way we can do that is to copy the whole
`ProjectX` directory, like this:

```bash
cd ..
cp --recursive ProjectX ProjectX-v0
cd ProjectX
```

Nice! Well, sort of.

When we run our program we see that we forgot to print new line at the end.
Let's fix this.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
	printf("ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.\n");
}
```

We can see the differences between this version and `v0` like this:

```bash
diff --recursive --unified ../ProjectX-v0 .
```

The `--recursive` option tells `diff` go compare the directories recursively,
and the `--unified` -- to show the differences in the so-called unified format.

```diff
--- ../ProjectX-v0/main.c	2021-09-06 13:58:33.718024787 +0300
+++ ./main.c	2021-09-06 13:58:46.690096675 +0300
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 #include <stdio.h>

 void main() {
-	printf("ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.");
+	printf("ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.\n");
 }
```

As you can see, the file `main.c` has one line removed and one line added.

OK, it's time to save this new version of our software:

```bash
cd ..
cp --recursive ProjectX ProjectX-v1
cd ProjectX
```

### Archives

One of the problems with copying folders like that is, that they tend to take a
lot of space. Also, it's easy to accidentally change things in the "archive"
folder, instead of in the working one.

We can fix these by using zip files instead of folders. Zip files still can be
changed, but at least it's harder to do so by mistake.

Let's also start calling these archives commits. For now a commit is just a
snapshot of the current sources, stored in a zip file.

Here's how to "convert" the old directories to the new format:

```bash
cd ..
cd ProjectX-v0
zip -r ../ProjectX-v0.zip .
cd ..
cd ProjectX-v1
zip -r ../ProjectX-v1.zip .
cd ..
rm -rf ProjectX-v0 ProjectX-v1 # remove the old directories
```

One thing we can't do directly anymore is to compare versions. But we can just
unzip the version(s) that we need in some temporary folders and then compare.
It's a bit of a hassle, but we can automate it with a small script if we want
to.

Another thing I don't like is, that the version archives are just lying around
and littering the parent directory. Let's move them in a new folder inside the
project:

```bash
cd ProjectX
mkdir -p .repo/commits
mv ../ProjectX-v0.zip .repo/commits/c0.zip
mv ../ProjectX-v1.zip .repo/commits/c1.zip
```

In Linux, UNIX and macOS files and folders starting with dot `.` are "hidden".
If you type `ls` you won't see them, but if you type `ls -a` you will. Besides
that, they are just normal files and folders.

We created a `commits` folder inside, because we'll proably want to put other
things in the `.repo` in the future.

To see how our current system works, let's modify the `main.c` file again and
make a new version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
	printf("CATS: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.\n");
}
```

```bash
zip -r .repo/commits/c2.zip .
```

```
  adding: main.c (stored 0%)
  adding: .repo/ (stored 0%)
  adding: .repo/commits/ (stored 0%)
  adding: .repo/commits/c1.zip (stored 0%)
  adding: .repo/commits/c0.zip (stored 0%)
  adding: main (deflated 85%)
  adding: main.o (deflated 67%)
```

Oops! We added the previous commits in the zip file too. Notice that we are also
storing the `main.o` and `main` files. These are not needed as they are
generated by the compiler.

To fix this, let's create a list of files that we want to track. We'll put it in
another hidden folder, called `.commit`.

```bash
mkdir .commit
```

Put the following in a `.commit/track` file:

```
.commit/*
main.c
```

```bash
rm .repo/commits/c2.zip
zip -r -i@.commit/track .repo/commits/c2.zip .
```

The `-i@.commit/track` option tells `zip` to include only the files mentioned in
the `.commit/track` file.

### Branches

So far our versions are named sequentially `c0`, `c1`, `c2` and so on. And this
order is the only thing that tells us that `c2` was created from `c1`, and that
`c1` was created from `c0`. That's good enough for linear development, but is
very insufficient for branching development.

But what are branches and why do we need them? Suppose that we have released
`c2` in the world, and are working on new features. We have created new commits
`c3` and `c4`, but overall the feature is not ready yet.

While we are working on it, we receive complaints about some major problem in
`c2`. And our customers can't wait for us to finish with our new feature. They
need a fixed `c2` now!

Luckily, we do have our `c2` source code. We can "switch" to it, fix the bug,
and release the good version. But where should we put the fix itself?

We might be tempted to temporary save the changes somewhere, switch back to our
`c4` version, then apply the fix and make a `c5` commit. After all, we do want
this fix to be part of the next version that we are going to release, right?

But what if there's yet another problem with the "fixed" `c2`? We wouldn't be
able to go back to exactly this code, as we didn't save it anywhere. No, we need
a better solution.

We can modify the commits, so they "know" which their parrent commit is. Let's
add this in another file, called `.commit/info`. For `c2` its content will look like
this:

```
parent: c1
```

Since it is in the `.commit` folder, it will be tracked automatically.

The first commit is a bit special as it doesn't have a parent. Its
`.commit/info` will look like this:

```
parent:
```

We can also add more information to this file like:
* author of the commit
* date and time of the commit
* one line summary
* bigger, multi-line description of the changes

But we won't do that in this tutorial, to keep things simple.

We went back and fixed all our commits to have this file. Now we can switch back
to `c2`, implement the fix and create a new commit, let's say `c5`. The commit
history will now look like this:

```
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4
             \
               -- c5
```

Good! Now we can go back to `c5` when we need to.

Like when we needed to properly fix the broken fix from before. Let's assume we
added one more commit to `c4`, we then went back to `c5` and implemented the new
fix on top of it. The picture now will look like this:

```
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6
             \
               -- c5 -- c7
```

### Names

So far so good, but we have just 2 branches and it's getting a bit tedious to
remember the top commit for each of them. Let's name them!

We can have a file for each branch, containing the name of the most recent
commit of this branch. For the `main` branch this will be `c6` and for
`release-1` -- `c7`:

```bash
mkdir .repo/branches
echo 'c6' > .repo/branches/main
echo 'c7' > .repo/branches/release-1
```

The `echo 'c6' > .repo/branches/main` command will just create a new file called
`.repo/branches/main` and make its content be `c6`. If the file already exists,
it will overwrite it.

Let's create another commit in our `main` branch to see how it works:

```bash
# Set the parent info:
echo 'parent: c6' > .commit/info

# Make the commit:
zip -r -i@.commit/track .repo/commits/c8.zip .

# Update the branch pointer:
echo 'c8' > .repo/branches/main
```

This is tedious and errorprone. I hope somebody will create a program to
automate it ...

### Switching

Above I was saying things like "let's switch to `c2`", or "let's switch to
`main`", but I never explained how. Here is how:

```bash
# Remove all the files and subfolders except for `.repo`:
rm -rf * .commit

# Unzip the relevant commit
unzip .repo/commits/c2.zip
```

It's not that bad, if we ignore the ugly way we clean up the working folder,
right?

But what if we now go to lunch, and when we come back next day we forget which
commit we switched to? Yes, sometimes lunches are that long. We could write
some code and then commit:

```bash
# Set the parent info:
echo 'parent: c8' > .commit/info

# Make the commit:
zip -r -i@.commit/track .repo/commits/c9.zip .

# Update the branch pointer:
echo 'c9' > .repo/branches/main
```

Oops! We committed in the wrong branch! The commit was based off of `c2` but we
forgot that and treated it as if it was based on `c8` instead.

It's time to add another level of indirection. We can create a file
`.repo/HEAD`, which will contain the name of the current branch or commit.

Switching to a branch will look like this:

```bash
# Remove all the files and subfolders except for `.repo`:
rm -rf * .commit

cat .repo/branches/main
# This will tell us which commit the main brach points to

# Unzip the relevant commit
unzip .repo/commits/c8.zip

# Update HEAD to point to a branch
echo 'branches/main' > .repo/HEAD
```

Switching to a commit -- like this:

```bash
# Remove all the files and subfolders except for `.repo`:
rm -rf * .commit

# Unzip the relevant commit
unzip .repo/commits/c2.zip

# Update HEAD to point to specific commit
echo 'commits/c2' > .repo/HEAD
```

You might be wondering why would you want to switch to a specific commit instead
to a branch? A common case is if you want to go back a couple of commits to see
if a bug was present there or not.

In git, this situation when the HEAD points to a specific commit instead of a
branch, is known as a "detached HEAD state". I mention it here, because it
sounds scary (and a bit gruesome), but it's really nothing to worry about.

Let's switch back to `main` as shown above and make a commit there:

```bash
cat .repo/HEAD
# --> branches/main (ok, we're on the main branch)

cat .branches/main
# --> c8 (the top commit of main is c8)

# Set the parent info:
echo 'parent: c8' > .commit/info

# Make the commit:
zip -r -i@.commit/track .repo/commits/c9.zip .

# Update the branch pointer:
echo 'c9' > .repo/branches/main
```

Notice that, even though we made a new commit, we didn't have to change
`.repo/HEAD` as we are still on the same branch.

### Merging

Here is the current situation:

```
                                  HEAD -> main
                                           |
                                           v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9
             \
               -- c5 -- c7
                        ^
                        |
                    release-1
```

We want to create a new release, but first we want to grab the fixes from
`release-1` and apply them to our `main` branch.

One way to do that, is the following:
1. Find the most recent commit, which is parent to both `c9` and `c7`. This is
   `c2`.
2. Find the changes between `c2` and `c7` (the `release-1` branch). We can unzip
   both the commits in 2 temporary folders and then `diff -r -u c2-temp c7-temp >
   changes.diff` them.
3. Patch the code in the working folder (`c9`): `patch < changes.diff`
4. Manually fix any conflicts
5. Commit

There's one more thing. This new commit should have two parents. So let's make
its `.commit/info` file read

```
parent: c9 c7
```

And the full picture now looks this way:

```
                                        HEAD -> main
                                                 |
                                                 v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  /
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------
                         ^
                         |
                     release-1
```

As you can see, we moved only `main`, but left `release-1` unchanged. That is
because we merged the latter into the former.

### Centralized & Distributed Version Control Systems

Centralized VCSes operate in the client-server model. You have a central server,
containing the repository and clients, which normally would get only specific
commits. Each client communicates only with the server. There is a single
repository and clients have only specific versions of the code.

Distributed VCSes operate in the peer-to-peer model. A developer can obtain a
full copy of the repository from any peer they are connected to. There are
multiple repositories and they may begin to diverge.

The distributed model is the newer one. Some of its advantages are:
* Allowing you to work even without internet connection.
* You can have private branches, that are available only in your own repository.
  You can decide to make them public when the code is ready, to keep them
  private or to delete them without the other developers ever seeing or knowing
  about them. This is important, because you can write experimental code and
  still follow good practices like breaking your changes in meaningful commits.
* Many operations are local and so are faster than going through a central
  server. For example you can see the commit history, checkout an older commit,
  create a new branch from it and make a new commit in it all without needing to
  connect to any outside server (except for StackOverflow of course).
* You can use various development workflows besides the centralized one.

Git is a Distributed VCS, so it leaves us with little choice in the matter: our
system also needs to be distributed.

### Commits revisited

The business is booming, our project gets bigger and we recruit a new developer
to help us. But for some strange reason they don't want to cummute each day from
their home in Madagascar, so we agree to work remotely.

For starters let's send them a full copy of the repository: the content of the
`.repo` directory. Let's say they will be working on account support for ProjectX
(log-in and profile management), while we're working on the highly requested
improve-memefication feature.

Next let's create a new branch in our repo, starting from where `main` is
pointing to and add a new commit there with our initial memefication support.

```
                                           HEAD -> memefication
                                                        |
                                               main     v
                                                |   -- c11
                                                v /
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  /
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------
                         ^
                         |
                     release-1
```

Meanwhile, the other developer is churning code as well and are creating their
very first branch and commit in their repository:

```
                                        HEAD -> main
                                                 |
                                                 v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c11
                         ^                              ^
                         |                              |
                      release-1              HEAD -> profiles
```

There's our first problem: both new commits have the same ID: `c11`. This
happens because there are two copies of the repository and they don't know about
the changes that happened in the other copy. In fact they don't know there's
another copy at all.

There are many ways to fix this. We can assign a unique ID to each copy of the
repository (let's say `a` and `b` in our case) and use that ID as part of the
commit's IDs: `a:c11` and `b:c11`. An assigning of unique IDs to each repo is easy
right now, but in highly distributed project it might cause a hassle.

We could use random numbers and hope that there won't be any collisions.
Instead, we'll do something better: we'll compute a SHA-1 sum of the zip file
and use that as the commit ID.

SHA-1 is a cryptography hash algorithm. It takes any input and produces a
20-byte (160 bit) output, called the hash. For same inputs it will produce same
outputs, but even a slight variation in the input will cause a big change in the
output. SHA-1 is no longer considered safe, so you should not use it for
cryptography, but for our case it's good enough. You can always go with
something stronger, like SHA-256 or SHA-512 if you want.

We'll have to fix all our previous IDs as well as their references in the
`.commit/info` and `.repo/branch` files.

Here is our modified commit procedure:

```bash
# Set the parent info:
echo 'parent: 2390b3548a22cb3b1ca3b2a5fd4442d1d83ec556' > .commit/info

# Make the commit. We don't know the ID yet, so we'll initially name it tmp.zip
zip -r -i@.commit/track .repo/commits/tmp.zip .

# Now compute the ID: The line starting with "# -> " is the output:
sha1sum .repo/commits/tmp.zip
# -> ba406507fa691403dca5f5ea4cd6f75320b7d512  .repo/commits/tmp.zip

# And rename the zip file:
mv .repo/commits/tmp.zip .repo/commits/ba406507fa691403dca5f5ea4cd6f75320b7d512.zip

# Update the branch pointer:
echo 'ba406507fa691403dca5f5ea4cd6f75320b7d512' > .repo/branches/main
```

I'll continue to use names like `c1` in the text and diagrams, but those will be
just for brevity. The real IDs will be the SHA-1 hashes.

### Collaboration and Remote Repositories

We'll set up a server, let's call it `the-hub` which will also contain a full
copy of the `.repo` folder and both we and the new person will have access to
it. What kind of access? We'll be able to send and receive files and execute
commands. So almost full access. (We'll be able to restrict this in the future.)

We want to implement the central repository model, for which both Centralized
and Distributed VCSes have good support. It is an easy and common model and is a
good fit for this tutorial. In it both developers will be synchronizing their
work through `the-hub`. Technically speaking, its repository is no different
than the other two. But we'll consider the version of the code in it to be the
"real" one. When we create a version of our system, we'll grab the code from
`the-hub`. Sometimes such repositories are said to be "blessed".

So far we have 3 repositories but they have no knowledge about the existence of
the others.

The repository in `the-hub` looks like this:

```
                                        HEAD -> main
                                                 |
                                                 v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  /
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------
                        ^
                        |
                    release-1
```

Ours looks is:

```
                                           HEAD -> memefication
                                                        |
                                               main     v
                                                |   -- c11
                                                v /
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  /
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------
                        ^
                        |
                    release-1
```

And the other dev's repo is:

```
                                                main
                                                 |
                                                 v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c12
                        ^                               ^
                        |                               |
                    release-1                HEAD -> profiles
```

Since we know how to connect to `the-hub` from our machine, let's put that in a
new file `.repo/config` in our local repository:

```cfg
[remote "origin"]
    url = the-hub:/data/.repo
```

We are defining a connection which we named `origin`. For now we have a single
parameter: `url`, which tells us on which server (`the-hub`) and where on this
server (`/data/.repo`) is the repository.

We can define multiple remotes if we need a more involved development workflow.

To be able to synchronize the repositories we need to implement two procedures:
fetching stuff from the remote repository and pushing our stuff to the remote
repository.

### Fetching

We are on our computer and we want to get the latest stuff from `origin`. We
need to download the branch info (the files in `the-hub:/data/.repo/branches`).
But we can't just put them in our local `.repo/branches` as they may override
our local view of the branches. For example, we might have locally added a new
commit `c13` to `main`. If we overwrite `.repo/branches/main` with the one from
`origin` we'll lose the reference to `c13`.

Let's instead create a new directory structure like this:
```
.repo/
  remotes/
    origin/        # The name is the same as the one in `.repo/config` file
      branches/
        main       # These are the branch files as we've copied them
        release-1  # from origin
```

We'll call these "remote branches".

We'll also need any commits we are missing. Because they are named uniquely we
can just put them with the rest in `.repo/commits`. We don't want to download
any commits we already have. One approach to do that would be to start from the
commits in the remote branches and download them, then their parents, and their
parent's parents until we hit commits that we already have (or the root commit).

It is safer to store them in some temporary folder until we downloaded all
needed commits. We can also ensure the integrity of the zip files by computing
their SHA-1 hashes and compare them to their names. That way we won't store any
partial commits (that is, commits that are not fully downloaded or have missing
parents).

Each time we fetch from `origin` we'll be updating our knowledge of the current
state of the branches and commits that are there.

```
                                         origin/main          main
                                                 |             |
                                                 v             v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10 -- c13 -- c15
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c11
                        ^                               ^
                        |                               |
                    release-1, origin/release-1         |
                                                        |
                                             HEAD -> memefication
```

As you can see `origin` is a bit behind. It doesn't know about the `c13` and
`c15` commits and it has no idea about the `memefication` branch.

### Pushing

The code in `c13` is quite important and we want to make it available as soon as
possible. For this we need to _push_ our changes to `origin`.

Pushing involves:
* uploading the new commits
* updating the branches on the remote repository (that is, the repository
  located on `the-hub`)
* updating the remote branches (these are the local copies of the above
  branches)

The first step is easy: we can start with the commit that we want to upload,
`c13` and start uploading until we find commits that are already on the remote.
It is safer to do it in the reverse order, so that parent commits are uploaded
first. This way each uploaded commit will reference already uploaded commits. We
should also verify the SHA-1 hashes.

Next comes updating the branch on the remote machine. But we should be careful!
The file there might have changed since the last time we fetched it. We'll
assume that we can do the check and update _atomically_, that is the file cannot
change between the time we compare its content and the time we update them. (One
way we can ensure this is by using
[flock](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/flock.1.html)). If this check
fails we should fail the whole _push_ operation and ask the user to use _fetch_
to update their local repository first.

Note that the remote repository still doesn't know about the `memefication`
branch or about the `c11` commit. This is good as we're still not ready to share
this code.

### Merging

Let's see what the other developer is up to. (We should really try to remember
their name already!)

It looks like they've finished their `profiles` branch and are ready to merge it
with `main`.

```
                                                main
                                                 |
                                                 v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c12 -- c14
                        ^                                      ^
                        |                                      |
                    release-1                      HEAD -> profiles
```

Their first step is to fetch the latest code from `origin`.

```
                                        HEAD -> main        origin/main
                                                 |             |
                                                 v             v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10 -- c13 -- c15
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c12 -- c14
                        ^                                      ^
                        |                                      |
                    release-1                      HEAD -> profiles
```

They can now see that their local `main` and `origin/main` differ. In this case
`c10` (`main`) is a parent to `c15` (`origin/main`). We can merge them by
"fast-forwarding" the `main` branch:

```
                                               HEAD -> main, origin/main
                                                               |
                                                               v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10 -- c13 -- c15
             \                                  / \
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c12 -- c14
                        ^                                      ^
                        |                                      |
                    release-1                      HEAD -> profiles
```

Now, let's merge `profiles` into `main` by creating a merge commit. They can
also remove the branch `profiles` as it is no longer needed (don't worry, the
commits are still there):

```
                                                      origin/main   main <-- HEAD
                                                               |      |
                                                               v      v
c0 -- c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 -- c6 -- c8 -- c9 -- c10 -- c13 -- c15 -- c16
             \                                  / \                  /
               -- c5 -- c7 --------------------     -- c12 -- c14 --
                        ^
                        |
                    release-1
```

They can now push `main` to `origin`, which will upload the `c12`, `c14` and
`c16` commits and will move forward the `main` branch on `the-hub`.

## Git

I will now make what is known as a pro move, and direct you to the excellent
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. It is free and easy to read, and
hopefully, even easier to understand.

It might look like a cop-out and it is. But there are already quite a few good
tutorials, which describe how to use git. My main objective here was to describe
how git works and to some extent to answer the question "why is it like that".

There are a few concepts that I wanted to include, but didn't. Specifically the
staging area, which is also sometimes called "the index" and the tracking
branches. Both are not hard to explain, but would make this already sizeable
tutorial bigger and probably a bit more confusing.
